00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
what's going on everybody and welcome to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
a creating a reddit bot tutorial in

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Python so what we're gonna be doing

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
specifically is creating a reddit bot

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that goes through and detects reddit

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
spam and affiliate links specifically in

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
this case to udemy but we could very

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
easily modify this to detect quite a bit

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of spam so over like the last year I've

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
noticed this is crazy sharp incline in

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the amount of just udemy affiliate link

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
spam coming in to Reddit and it's hard I

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
think to catch because they're not

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
necessarily directly linking to to udemy

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
they're kind of linking to some other

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
tracker site that then links to udemy so

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a lot of times they link to a Twitter

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
post that links to udemy or links to a

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
tracker site that links to udemy or they

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
link to a medium post and so on now that

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
seems to be on the decline and now

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
they're actually not even doing that

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
extra step they're they're actually just

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
linking direct to to the tracker site

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
then which goes to udemy and they're not

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
even being kind of hidden about it most

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
of the time they're saying udemy and all

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
this kind of stuff so anyways I thought

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
about writing a bot a long time ago to

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
do this and detect this kind of spam but

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
there are just so many other things I

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
wanted to spend my time on I didn't

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
really feel like doing it that was until

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a few days ago I found some reddit spam

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to you to udemy course that was actually

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a pirated course of my courses a direct

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
rip from YouTube even the author's bio

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
on udemy was a rip from H Kingsley com

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so just a total pirated course and this

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
was being spammed on reddit so why don't

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you know I found some time I found some

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
motivation and I wrote the bot so here

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
it is I'm gonna run through it with you

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
guys we're not gonna be writing it line

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
by line I'm gonna kind of copy the the

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
method I did with the latest one of the

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
latest tutorials if you want to learn

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
more about working with Priscilla go to

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the project Oriole series like this is

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
just going to be part four of that

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
series so if you want to learn more

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
about interacting with the the reddit

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
objects and stuff like that check that

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
out this is really just a application I

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
mean just kind of showing you it going

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so the first thing that we're gonna want

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
to do obviously have a reddit account

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
suck the API again go through the

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
process if you don't know how to do that

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but basically make an account go to your

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
account preferences app create the app

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
make sure it's a script app that's about

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it really

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
fill out the form so once you've done

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that you'll have your credentials client

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
ID secret password user agent username

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm putting these into a prom on your

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
score creds dot PI this is a copy of

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that because the real one actually has

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
my real values and I don't wanna show it

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to you so anyway and then I've got a to

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
catch a press to catch a scammer dot PI

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
script so with that let's go ahead and

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
get started

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the first things we're going to need to

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
do is import that proc creds the client

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
ID oh by the way you don't have to write

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
all this out I have a link in the

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
description to this tutorial also the

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
code is on github so if you want to

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
contribute or check out the code or

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
whatever it's it's up there I'll put a

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
link in the description but it's just

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ram spam reddit spam detector bot okay

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so once we've got that the next thing

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that I want to do is basically we create

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the reddit object itself pass through

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
all the credential stuff and all that

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and then we kind of have to figure out

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
okay how are we gonna catch these people

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
how are we gonna figure out who's a

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
spammer who's not because just because

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
someone's posting a link that does go to

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
udemy it doesn't necessarily mean that

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
they're a spammer I mean they're

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
probably a spammer but we can't just

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
assume at that point that they're a

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
spammer so what we actually need to do

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
is probably go through all of the posts

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but then like go through posts that are

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
linking to udemy stuff but then also go

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to that username and then check out that

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
username or all of their posts to udemy

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
junk or is just some of it or you know

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
whatever cuz sometimes like I thought it

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
was probably the course creators just

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the course creator that created the

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
course and then they went to you read it

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to kind of spam it out but no these are

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
definitely massive spam rings so I found

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
so much like they're huge

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I didn't realize how big this problem

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
was until I I really started looking

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
into it's pretty it's pretty nuts anyway

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
so what I've done here is I'll pull up

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
so for example let me pull up my little

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
boy

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
guy so this is my spam detector bot and

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
basically what he does is he just you

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
know he's just going to these threads

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and just post this message basically so

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I get in this case this guy I don't even

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
know this name it's just a spam name

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
we're just saying hey you know six a

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
third of these 33 submissions from this

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
user appear to be udemy affiliate links

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and the reason we can know that is if we

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
actually go to this user account we just

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
click on it and we can see like look at

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
all of these courses really a hundred

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
percent of these are courses in my case

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we're just looking for the term udemy

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
but in time I plan to expand that out

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
because obviously especially once

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
somebody figures out that I'm looking

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
for the term udemy they'll just remove

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the term udemy so so that'll that'll

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
change for sure we'll come up with

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
better words and stuff and ways to match

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
courses there's lots of little things

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not sure I'm going to go over all of

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
them I don't want to give away the

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
tricks to the trade but anyways yeah so

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
it's pretty quick and easy to go to

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
these people's page and figure out this

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is a spam bot or a spammer I'm actually

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
not confident these are BOTS I think it

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
might actually be a human behind them

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
anyways we're gonna move these aside now

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
so that's what we need to do we need to

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
get to this user and look through his

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
content so so we can do all of that with

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the Python reddit API wrapper so what

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
we're going to do first is find a just

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
bind spam by a username so the function

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that I wrote for that or find spam and

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
then return the user names so basically

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
what we're gonna do here is we're just

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
going to go through a search query and

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
just log all of the authors right

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and then what we're gonna do here is

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
let's just iterate through that real

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
quick just to show you an example of it

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
running so paste and then I'll run that

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
so here we have just the list basically

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
just ran through you know the posts and

168
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
then here are the users so all these

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
people are suspicious at least but again

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
these are just people who have posted

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
about udemy we don't know anything more

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
about them so we really kind of want to

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
dig a little deeper into these users to

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
really determine whether or not they're

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
there spammer or they're just a regular

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
person sharing a link to their course so

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
now I'm going to go ahead and do is just

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
overwrite this kind of loop here and so

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
instead what we're going to do is we're

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
gonna search for query and right now

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
we're just gonna random choice for udemy

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
again later I would add many many more

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
terms to that because again if we're

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
just looking for udemy if these spammers

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
were to find out that that's the one

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
thing that is the crux to this entire

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
code they'll just stop posting udemy

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
they'll they'll just stop using that

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
word because it's really not essential

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
so anyways once we find that we're gonna

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
have spam content trashy users and then

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
basically smelly authors we don't know

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
if these authors are trashy but they

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
smell bad so we're gonna figure out a

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
little bit more about them so also we're

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
using random here so let's go ahead and

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
at this stage we need to import random

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
okay so once we have these smelly

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
authors we want to start iterating

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
through the smelly authors to figure out

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
what their deal is so come down here pay

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so make sure we're not having a tab

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
issue good and let me make sure this is

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
set right and then okay cool so what

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
we're going to do is now we start

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
iterating over those authors so for each

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
author in smelly authors we're gonna say

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we're gonna start counting how many

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
trashy URLs do they have how many

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
submissions did they make and how many

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
of those submissions are dirty so then

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
what we want to have is something that

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is like common spammy words so I'm gonna

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
actually come up to the top here and

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just paste that in so common spam you

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
weren't worms udemy course save coupon

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
free discount as a matter of fact really

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
a lot of these things like for sure

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
course coupon discount chances are if

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
someone has these things in there it's

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
probably spam

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
anyway and then if the user continues

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
like again if we just if we search for

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
spammy words and then we only matched

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
these spammy words if like more than 50

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
percent of a user

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
content is always this junk there a

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
spammer so so anyway that's just again

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to point out you know the the udemy

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
should not be the only word that you're

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
going to use I'm just gonna do it for

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
this tutorial I don't want to give away

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
all the great words but we'll see I'm

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
gonna have it up on github for a little

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
bit and if people contribute then we

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
could probably leave it open source and

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it won't be a big deal if people can

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
stay ahead of it but this isn't exactly

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the most exciting task in the world so

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not really sure how many people are

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
gonna help but it's it's kind of fun to

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
combat these guys so anyway the next

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
thing that we're gonna do is basically

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we want to run through their submissions

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
so we found the author now I want to

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
iterate over that authors submission so

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
we want to visit their profile so I'm

248
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
gonna paste in that chunk of code let me

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
zoom out a little bit there so it all

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
fits so we want to throw a try and

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
accept into here mostly because the post

252
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
might have been made by that author but

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
these authors are spam authors they're

254
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
they're going to eventually be removed

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
from reddit so when that happens

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
sometimes these users will return error

257
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
codes if you try to access them

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
otherwise what we're going to do is

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
basically we're going to say is for

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
submission in that redditors and then

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
string author because at this point

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
author is actually an object it's an

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
author object from the reddit instance

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
so from whatever that authors user name

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
is their submissions ordered by new

266
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we're gonna start iterating over them so

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we're gonna see where that submission

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
links to at the moment I don't actually

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
think I'm using this but this is another

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
great thing to track to figure out if

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
someone's a spammer right now they're

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
using the same kind of websites so one

273
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you could figure out they're a spammer

274
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but two you could also link them to

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
other spammers and this is what I

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
started to do to identify the networks

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
themselves so the people that are

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
spamming to the same kind of trackers

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
they're pretty much all connected and

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
given the fact that they all have very

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
similar usernames I'm gonna go ahead and

282
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
say it's probably the same group that's

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
doing this but anyways moving right

284
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
along I'm not actually using that right

285
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
now I don't think but it's still

286
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
something good to track otherwise we

287
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
take the ID so we can quickly get to it

288
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
actually I'm not even sure we're

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
tracking that anymore

290
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
because I think we just get the URL to

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it but anyways we also want to track the

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
subreddit again just in case there's

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
like a udemy freebies subreddit that is

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
basically all affiliate spam so I think

295
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
everybody in that subreddit probably

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
knows exactly what that subreddit is

297
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's like literally probably for

298
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
spammers so not really sure what to say

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
about that honestly I feel like that sub

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
should just be deleted whatever but then

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
we're gonna say dirty equals false and

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
iterate through the spammy words and

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
then for each word in the submit title

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
dot lower what we want to do is if I'm

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
sorry if the word is in the submit title

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
lower that way we lowercase everything

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
if it is then we're going to say dirty

309
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is equal to true we probably should

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
break at this point and not way soon

311
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
it's not gonna I would break at this

312
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
point but we're gonna continue on

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
anyways and then if that junk is not

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
already in the users trashy URLs let's

315
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
go ahead and add some information the

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
submission ID the title and the author's

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
name into there and then if this is

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
dirty what we're gonna do is we're gonna

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
add two dirty count add to the sub count

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and we're just it's just basically a

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
counter a counter for that now what we

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
want to do is if if the trashy score is

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
above something basically so we want to

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
generate this kind of track oh we don't

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
have a trashy score so let me copy and

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
paste this new block because actually

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this one's going to change so really

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
we're just adding a little bit under

329
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
here but basically what we're gonna say

330
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
is so like what we did up to this point

331
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
is like right here right that's what

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
we've just covered here what we're gonna

333
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
say is we're gonna try to say the trashy

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
score is equal to however many dirty

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
posts as person made over the total that

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
they have if we fail for whatever reason

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
for example sometimes the sub count will

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
be zero again some sort of weird error

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you'll get a Divya so we're just gonna

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
say trashy score is zero otherwise it's

341
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
just the percentage of trashy posts so

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we'll just print this out you could

343
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
leave this or or get rid of it honestly

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
this won't take too much of your time so

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you could just leave it

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
anyway if the trashy score right now is

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
above 50% we're gonna add this user to

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the trash users and then for each trash

349
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
in trashy or user trashy URLs we're

350
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
gonna add that to the spam content in

351
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
general so once we get to this point

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
what we could do let's go ahead and run

353
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
this and make sure this actually works

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
so at this point we were just returning

355
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you users let's go ahead and run this

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
real quick and make sure we don't have

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
errors

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
okay so we're already running through it

359
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we've found online free courses their

360
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
trash D score is basically 92% we've

361
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
already run through tools break that

362
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
anyway so clearly this guy's a spammer

363
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
this guy's a spammer this guy's probably

364
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
a spammer for some reason his ratio is

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
at forty four we've this is actually the

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
guy shows you initially I think so

367
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
anyway probably we should lower it maybe

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to 30% I mean if more than 30% of a user

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
submissions or spam maybe that's worth

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
pointing out I don't know I can't decide

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
on what a good number is but I feel like

372
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
definitely more than 50% they're a piece

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of junk so so once we've identified

374
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
who's a piece of junk what we want to do

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is then iterate over that and then post

376
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
of it because now we know it is true the

377
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
junk so every time we make a post at

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
least on a brand new account we have

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
like a timer it's like a 10 minute or 8

380
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
minutes or something like that so every

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
time we make a post we also want to

382
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
sleep so we're gonna import time here

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and then I'm gonna scroll on down and

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
now what we want to do is basically just

385
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
iterate over the whatever we have now in

386
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
spam content so I'm just going to come

387
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
down here and I'm gonna paste this in

388
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm gonna scroll out and make sure we

389
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
did that right let me confirm that real

390
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
quick

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
yeah so once we get to this point let me

392
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
pull this back down zoom in we're gonna

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
start iterating over the spam content so

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
we're gonna identify the ID the user the

395
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
submission itself when was that

396
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
submission created if that was less than

397
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
a day ago that's just 60 times 60 times

398
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
24 if that was less than a day ago then

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
full link would be to reddit.com slash

401
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
submission I just want to save this for

402
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
myself at least initially when I was

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
writing this I just I really wanted to

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
make sure I wasn't accusing someone spam

405
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that wasn't spamming so I've been I'm

406
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
gonna save all the links basically then

407
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
this is our message we're just be Boop

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
we're a bot we're identifying this idiot

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
they're a spammer get rid of them that

410
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
kind of stuff

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and then we're just using string

412
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
formatting passing it on in there and

413
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
letting them know

414
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so once we've we've got that message

415
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
what we're gonna go ahead and do is

416
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
first we're gonna check the post of URLs

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
text this is just a quick file that

418
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
we're just gonna check and see if we've

419
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
already posted to that file if we have

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
then we're gonna skip it but if we

421
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
haven't so if that links not already in

422
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the already posted what we're gonna want

423
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to do is let's print out the message

424
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
let's go ahead and make a reply to that

425
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
reddit post then we're going to print

426
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
out that we've posted to and whatever

427
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the link is and then we're going to

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
write that link to the post of URLs text

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
file and then we're gonna sleep for 12

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
minutes and then we're gonna break

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
because we don't want to necessarily

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
iterate through through everything we'd

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
rather like start clean and go with the

434
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
newest submissions again so we'll break

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
there other than that that's basically

436
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
it so we could we can run this now I'm

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
not sure if we'll actually find spam

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
this time around but let's just see

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
because I've been running this so I'm

440
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
not really sure that we'll find any spam

441
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but we'll see what we get and if we

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
don't see we return to 404 for some

443
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
username I don't know who it was but

444
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
anyway if we don't post what I can do is

445
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
we can at least we can well we can go

446
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
back further in history when we search

447
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
for posters and then we can also go back

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
further in history into the actual

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
spammers like right now we say we're not

450
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
we're not gonna post on anything older

451
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
than a day we we could at least when I

452
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
was writing this I didn't see any point

453
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to doing that especially if this is

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
running live there's no reason to go

455
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
back super 4 historically to do this but

456
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
yeah it doesn't look like we're gonna

457
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
find anything on this one

458
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but what I'll do I guess what I could do

459
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll pull this one over at least so at

460
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
least here we figure it out this one was

461
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
for online courses we found them we put

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it just says we've posted and then we're

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
gonna sleep for 12 minutes if we do

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
happen to find somebody what I'll do

465
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
real quick just to see if we can get

466
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
somebody else let me say I don't know 50

467
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and then at the point where we wait area

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
here so let's just say I don't know 10

469
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
let's try to rerun that and we'll see if

470
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we find anything I'm not really sure if

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:37,000
we will but we'll try

472
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
we fred anyway while we're waiting on

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that I'll just draw your attention one

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
more time - this is on github if you

475
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
want to make any contributions or

476
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
support it or whatever feel free to take

477
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
part other than that the codes also on

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Python programming at net running

479
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
through it kind of like I did here so if

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
you missed anything or whatever you can

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,000
go over there

482
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
yeah well get all these users we're fine

483
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
probably shouldn't set that limit to 50

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
probably should've just done the

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
historical - like 10 days or whatever

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
this is taken forever okay so we found

487
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
somebody so again it was online courses

488
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and it's on udemy freebies which is like

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
just a total spam subreddit but let's go

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
ahead and check them out anyway so we'll

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
just pay copy over here we'll head to

492
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that and here we are so there it is so

493
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in action running and just in general

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
being slightly annoying so far it looks

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
like people have been relatively

496
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
appreciative of of our BOTS but we'll

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
see I wasn't really sure what people

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
would think of it especially because

499
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
like I said it like on on udemy freebies

500
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm pretty sure that's all for spam and

501
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm not sure like if people actually

502
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
like that subreddit and find it useful

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
because they get cheap courses I'm not

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
really sure anyways that's it for now if

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
you guys have questions comments

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
concerns whatever feel free to even

507
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
below otherwise I'll see you in another

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,000
video
